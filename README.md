# Advent of Code 2024 - Multilingual Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024! This project contains my implementations of the daily coding challenges. The goal is to keep the code simple and avoid using any external libraries.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into folders, each representing a day's challenge:

- Each numbered folder (e.g., `1/`, `2/`) contains the solution and the input data for that day's challenge.

## About the Developer

I am a JavaScript developer learning new languages, such as Go, and others may be added in the future, like C#.

Feel free to customize it further as per your needs!
