# Advent of Code 2024 - JavaScript Solutions

Welcome to my JavaScript solutions for the Advent of Code 2024! This project contains my implementations of the daily coding challenges. The goal is to keep the code simple and avoid using any external libraries.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into folders, each representing a day's challenge:

- Each numbered folder (e.g., `1/`, `2/`) contains the solution (`index.js`) and the input data (`input.txt`) for that day's challenge.
- The `index.js` file in the root directory is the main entry point for running the solutions.

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's challenge, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

It will prompt and show which challenges are available for you to run.

Feel free to customize it further as per your needs!
