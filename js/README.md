## Project Structure

The project is organized into folders, each representing a day's challenge:

- Each numbered folder (e.g., `1/`, `2/`) contains the solution (`index.js`) and the input data (`input.txt`) for that day's challenge.
- The `index.js` file in the root directory is the main entry point for running the solutions.

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's challenge, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

It will prompt and show which challenges are available for you to run.

Feel free to customize it further as per your needs!
